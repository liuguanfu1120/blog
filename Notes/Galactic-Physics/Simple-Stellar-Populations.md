# Simple Stellar Populations (SSP)

## Definition

A simple stellar population (SSP) refers to a group of stars that are born at the same time, in the same volume of space, and from a gas cloud of homogeneous chemical composition.
SSPs are characterized by a single age and metallicity, and they serve as the basic building blocks for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their components.

## Why SSP?

The PCA of galaxy spectra reaveals that the spectra of galaxies are dominated by a few eigenspectra.
