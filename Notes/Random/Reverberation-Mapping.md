# Reverberation Mapping

## Basic idea

- Spectrum from AGN/quasar
    - Strong continuum: accretion onto black hole (BH)
    - Broad emission lines: gas excited by continuum radiation
- Gas near BH has high Doppler motions \Rightarrow broad line regions (BLRs)
- Changes in continuum level take time (time delay $\tau$, $R_{\mathrm{BLR}}=c\tau$) to reach BLRs
- Width of line \sigma is a measure of velocity of gas at $R_{\mathrm{BLR}}$
- BH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}}\approx f R_{\mathrm{BLR}} \sigma^{2}/G$, $f$ is determined by geometry

## Assumption and complication

- Virialized motions(there may be outflows, jets, winds, etc.)
- Unknown geometric factor $f$
- Adequate sampling to get accurate $\tau$
- BLRs may be contaminated by non-varying or slow varying narrow line regions (NLRs)
- Line blending (different $\tau$)
- Absorption along line of sight
- $L_{\mathrm{bol}}\ll L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ $\Rightarrow$ gravity dominates

## Comparison with other method

Result from RM method is often inconsistent with stellar dynamics with the same object
A discrepancy in relation $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-L_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ exists
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}-\sigma$ is much better correlation

## High redshift case

- $\tau \sim$ days/months, even to a year $\Rightarrow$ hard to monitor
- Can use C IV transition as standard line
- RM at high z is OK, likely accurate to factor of $3-4$

## BH evolution

- Extremely massive BHs already exist at $z=6$
- Supermassive BHs form first
- Host galaxies are not dynamically relaxed at high z, does $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-\sigma$  hold?
