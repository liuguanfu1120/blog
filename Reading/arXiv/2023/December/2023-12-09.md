## 1. [X-Ray Constraints on the Hot Gaseous Corona of Edge-on Late-type Galaxies in Virgo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04050)

### Main results and conclusions

- 1. It presents a systematic study of the putative hot gas corona around late-type galaxies (LTGs) residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations.
- 2. Significant extraplanar diffuse X-ray (0.5â€“2 keV) emission is detected in only
three LTGs (21 LTGs in total), which are also the three galaxies with the highest SFRs.
- 3. > The apparent paucity of hot gas coronae in the sampled Virgo LTGs might be understood as the net outcome of the long-lasting effect of ram pressure stripping exerted by the hot intra-cluster medium and in-disk star-forming activity acting on shorter timescales.

### The origin of the hot gas corona

There are two main origins of the hot gas corona (sometimes called hot gas \textit{halo}):

- 1. External origin: Dark matter collapses first and the baryon structure forms later in the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ paradigm.
The formation of the baryon structure is continuously supplied by accretion of the intergalactic medium (IGM), through which accretion shocks and gravitational compression heat the in-
fallen IGM heated to X-ray-emitting temperatures.
- 2. Internal origin: Cool gas forms stars. The stellar winds and supernovae heats cool gas.
